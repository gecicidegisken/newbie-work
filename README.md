# newbie-work
Some of the stuff I wrote while learning to code is stored in this repo. Most of them are quite silly but as the name suggests, they all are the work of a beginner. (:
I was not able to write codes in an excellent order back then so the projects and codes are not commented very well. Most of them commented to teach me what I was doing and the language is sometimes English and sometimes Turkish.


## Asistan
"Asistan" is a WinForms Application I did as a school project. It aimed using linked lists, stacks and queues effectively. 
And the app is simply an assistant to help you choose your tasks to focus. You enter your tasks into the program and later on, you choose the time you want to work. Asistan suggests available tasks according to the time and deletes it when you are done. The app is in Turkish and codes are mostly commented in Turkish.
